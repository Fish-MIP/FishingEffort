This file explores the global fishing effort data that will be used by the Fish-MIP community to force regional and global marine ecosystem models. To understand how this forcing can be integrated into regional models, we take the South East Australia system (LME 42) as a case study and aim at developing a framework that can be applied across regions (with necessary adjustments). We chose LME 42 because three ecosystem models are available for this region: Atlantis, EwE and Mizer. As a first step, we compares the LME 42 extraction of the global effort data with effort data used to force the three regional models. Specifically, we:  

1. Check whether effort trends across these data match   
2. Explore how the global effort can be allocated across regional models' fleets     

Atlantis, EwE and Mizer differ in terms of area covered and fisheries considered, so some deviation in effort trends is expected:  

* Atlantis is the more comprehensive model, it covers LME 42 and 43 and all main Commonwealth fisheries 
* Mizer covers LME 42 and focuses on the commonwealth trawling and shark gillnet fishery  
* EwE models the Bass Strait (a small subset of LME42) and considers both State and Commonwealth fisheries  

These models can be considered nested in terms of:   

* Area covered Atlantis -> Mizer -> EwE  
* Fisheries and fleets considered: Atlantis -> EwE (or vice versa?) -> Mizer  
This is key when interpreting trends in effort and exploring how effort can be allocated to fleets

Effort is used differently across these models:  

* Atlantis and EwE are forced by fishing effort   
* Mizer is forced by either fishing mortality, or fish price and fisheries costs - effort is used only for validation aims.   

Effort units:  

* global data: days at sea X kW  
* Atlantis data: days at sea    
* EwE data: relative effort (days at sea also available now)  
* Mizer data: number of operations

#### Key points for discussion

1. Aggregated LME-level effort trends do not match across global and regional dataset:

  * Difficulties in comparing effort across datasets due to different units and little years overlap. much shorter time series for regional forcing data.      
  * Differences across models can be due to different 1) scales and 1) fleets/fisheries considered -> Exploration of effort by fleet might clarify some of this.  

2. Atlantis and EwE show opposite trends between 1995 and 2005 -> Exploration of effort by fleet might clarify some of this.   
3. The global dataset seems to lag behind Atlantis in its increasing trend (1950-1990), and to lag behing EwE in its decreasing trend (1990-2017). Differences could be due to the presence of other fishing countries in the global dataset -> Check whether Australia is the only fishing country for LME 42 once the updated global data is available.     
   
**NOTE**: if trends were matching -> **anomaly approach** could be used to force regional models with LME-level effort data from the global dataset. This would still require matching fleets across global and regional datasets - NEXT STEP.       
   
## Explore fishing effort by fleet 

*Work in progress* - an updated version of the global effort data with functional groups + gears will be available soon. 

Flees within the global effort dataset can be defined as 'functional (target) group', 'gear' once the info is available, or a combination of 'functional group' and gear
