### column names (see emails from Yannick and notes on desktop re links to draft paper)

# eez_country_name = The EEZ/high seas name in which the Effort/Catch
# is occurring (Rich's note = which EEZ was used for the new aggregation?)
# fao_area = A number code to the FAO area, 
# as per FAO notation (Rich's note = which FAO was used for the new aggregation?)
# LME = A number code to the LME, as per NOAA notation (Rich's note = which FAO was used for the new aggregation?)
# SAUP = ?? "Fcountry": Fishing country, in ISO3 notation. Ex supranational entities (USSR, Yugoslavia) 
# are disaggregated to their constituent countries. Serbian Fishing Effort included with Montenegro.
# Gear = not here before 
# FGroup = Functional Group of the target species
# Sector = Fishing sector (artisanal/industrial), defined by the law of the country 
# (varies by country) - needs to be updated to I, UP and APW
# NomActive = ?? "NomEffTotal": Total nominal fishing effort (artisanal and industrial, including reported and IUU), 
# by country and year. Unmapped, non gear specific. where Nominal (i.e. not including the technological creep). 
# where Active (i.e., active vessels - from draft paper: reconstruction considers "the ratio of vessels in activity to the total capacity".
# unit is Kw
# EffActive = effective effort - i.e. including technological creep. 
# From draft paper:Effective effort has been calculated using a 3.5% creep average per year. 
# NV = "NumberVessels": Number of fishing vessels by country and year.
# P = ??"EnginePowerkW": Total engine power equivalent of the fishing fleet, by country and year. 
# The non-motorised fleet was given an engine power equivalent to half the engine power of small 
# (powered) vessels of that country (approx 2kW/vessel).
# GT = ?? gross tonnage
# Year = Year (end of the year) when the Effort/Catch is occurring

# load effort unmapped
# is teh pick for LME 42 present in the data before the mapping? kind of - but different trend with clear smoothing after the pick. ALos lots of smoothing pre mapping with all countries.
